# DSharpPlus
An official .NET wrapper for the Kuracord API, based off [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus), but rewritten for Kuracord.

# Installing
* The library can be directly referenced from your csproj file. Cloning the repository and referencing the library is as easy as:  
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Kuracord/KSharpPlus.git KSharpPlus-Repo
    ```
    Edit MyProject.csproj and add the following line:
    ```xml
    <ProjectReference Include="../KSharpPlus-Repo/KSharpPlus/KSharpPlus.csproj" />
    ```
    This belongs in the ItemGroup tag with the rest of your dependencies. The library should not be in the same directory or subdirectory as your project.
